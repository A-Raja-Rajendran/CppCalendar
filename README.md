# CppCalendar
A program which can generate a calendar of any month or year of your choice

## About:
This program has a total of 4 functions including main. It lets the user choose if he/she wants yearly calendar or moonthly calendar. Inputs include year for yearly calendar and both year and month for monthly calendar. The inputs are then sent to a calculating function which takes factors such as leap year, number of days in a particular month into account and finds out the day in which the first date of the month falls on. Using this, a whole calendar is generated.
